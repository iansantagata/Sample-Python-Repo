# Sample Python Repository

The purpose of this repository is to provide a sample Python repository for teaching Git and GitHub.

It is meant to be used as a sample only and not meant to have meaningful functionality.

## Quick Start

1. Run `./tools/bootstrap.sh` to install dependencies and install a virtual environment locally.
2. Follow the prompt and enter your environment type by number (usually `local`).
3. Run `export $(xargs < .env)` to export the environment variables loaded to your virtual environment.
4. Start coding all the things! :tada:
